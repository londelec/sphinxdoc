* PDF: Remove empty even-numbererd pages
	=> From Latex manual: Each \chapter starts on a fresh page, an odd-numbered page if the document is two-sided

* PDF: Figure out how to split row of a table that doesn't fit in one page (e.g. V36 doc releases)
	=> Latex doesn't support this, need to insert page breaks or horizontal lines manually.
* PDF: There is an extra blank text line above and below line-blocks in table cells.
	This is how latex \list and \itemize works - it adds \par on top and bottom, because it needs to measure space between \items and surrounding environemnt.
	Doesn't cause any issues in plain text, but table includes these empty lines in a cell.
	Info (https://tug.org/texinfohtml/latex2e.html#list)
	All options tried and working in plain text, but impossible to get rid of extra blank lines above and below \list in a table cell.
	Also info on lists (https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Lists?)
	Can use /usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/paralist/paralist.sty as a guidance, but will need to create a custom list ourselves to fix this.
